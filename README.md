Hello! 
This is the first portfolio I created. No frameworks, no jQuery, just HTML, CSS, Vanilla-JS and a minimal PHP-script to get the right timezone.
My greatest ambition was to make this site as accessible as I can, so I added Aria-Labels and ALT-textes to everything, used "menu" instead of 
an icon for a burger menu and checked the contrast of colors.

Please note that this is only the current status, there will be more to come.
